# NocticOS License

NocticOS - Equinoxtic

``Your Remake`` - ``Your-User``

This is the License for NocticOS.

If you're planning to make a rewrite / remake of NocticOS, follow the regulations here:

* Make it **Open-Source**
* Must be published on **Github**
* It should be a Public Repository for me to view.
* It is advised to have instructions / guides for Compiling your remake.

When giving out instructions / guides for Compiling your remake, you'll have to rewrite NocticOS' README file or make a new file either called ``Building.md`` or ``Compiling.md``

When making a release for your remake, it also needs to be published on your remake's releases page on Github, but I am allowing you to also publish it from Google Drive, or your own website (If you have one).
