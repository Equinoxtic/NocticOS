# NocticOS License

If you're planning to make a rewrite / remake of NocticOS, follow the regulations here:

* Make it **Open-Source**
* Must be published on **Github**
* It should be a Public Repository for me to view.
* It is advised to have instructions / guides for Compiling / Building your remake.

When giving out instructions / guides for Compiling your remake, you'll have to rewrite NocticOS' README file or make a new file either called ``BUILDING.md`` or ``COMPILING.md``

Additional Note: **When making a release for your remake, you are allowed and free to publish it on Third-Party Sources**
